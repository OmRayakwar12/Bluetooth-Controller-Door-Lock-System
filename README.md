# Bluetooth-Controller-Door-Lock-System

The Bluetooth Controlled Door Lock System works on the principle of wireless communication between a smartphone and a Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06). When a user sends a lock or unlock command from their phone, the Bluetooth module receives the signal and sends it to the 8051 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the command and controls a relay module, which operates the electronic door lock. This way, the door can be locked or unlocked remotely without using a physical key.
